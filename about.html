    <h2>Our Undertaking​</h2>
    <p>
        Powerful questions challenge the status quo in search for fresh insight, alternative thinking, new applications and more powerful solutions. Focusing on purpose is addressing ones “why”. Moreover, it’s about the journey, not the destination. A purpose perspective yields logic and is not complacent to settle or simply arrive at a conclusion.
    </p>
    <p>
        Logic alone is merely the product of yesterday’s knowledge. Purpose is the engine which compels each of us to continue the journey and implementation of ideas for today and tomorrow. At DO, we focus on purpose.​
    </p>
    <p>
        We choose to not rest in our journey and encirclement only of ideas. We embrace and the cross the bridge of implementation and seek further satisfaction in what we DO with our clients. We believe your success, is reflective of our success. ​
